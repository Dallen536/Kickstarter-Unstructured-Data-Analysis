Abstract- Kickstarter provides a way to make dreams or ideas a reality for those who wish to see their ideas come to life but may not have the financial means to do so themselves. When launching a Kickstarter campaign, a creator has the ability to share their ideas and goals with the world. At this time there have been 219,295 successfully funded projects on Kickstarter spanning many different categories and $6,570,743,435 USD pledged [1]. With the many numbers of projects and categories available, we decided to try to find the most successful categories over time and the overall trend of the categories. With this information, we will gather insights into which project categories and main categories may be the most beneficial to invest in.

The majority of our analysis was done in an AWS cluster with Spark DataFrame operations as well as Spark SQL.
